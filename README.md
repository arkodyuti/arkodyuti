- 👋 Hello there, I’m Arko (@arkodyuti) based in 📍 India
- 🎯 Driving developer education and community strategy at GitHub India
- 👀 Always finding ways to collaborate and help developers (Oh yes, I ❤️ hackathons)
- 🍕 Either I am on diet or I'm snacking on some cheeseburst (there's nothing in between) 😂
- 📫 I almost live on Twitter https://twitter.com/arkodyutisaha till I find my hideout somewhere in the 🏔
